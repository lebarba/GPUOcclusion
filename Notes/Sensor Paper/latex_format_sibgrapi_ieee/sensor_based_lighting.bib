  title =      "Real-Time Shadows",

  year =       "2011",
  abstract =   "Important elements of games, movies, and other
               computer-generated content, shadows are crucial for
               enhancing realism and providing important visual cues. In
               recent years, there have been notable improvements in visual
               quality and speed, making high-quality realistic real-time
               shadows a reachable goal.  Real-Time Shadows is a
               comprehensive guide to the theory and practice of real-time
               shadow techniques. It covers a large variety of different
               effects, including hard, soft, volumetric, and
               semi-transparent shadows.  The book explains the basics as
               well as many advanced aspects related to the domain of
               shadow computation. It presents interactive solutions and
               practical details on shadow computation. The authors compare
               various algorithms for creating real-time shadows and
               illustrate how they are used in different situations. They
               explore the limitations and failure cases, advantages and
               disadvantages, and suitability of the algorithms in several
               applications. Source code, videos, tutorials, and more are
               available on the bookâ€™s website.",
