Present a simple but powerful solution to GPU Stalls
Avoid latency when obtaining result of occlusion.
Discard is done at geometry stage discarding vertices.

Proposed this in GPU and accessible by shaders.

Assumptions:
	Geometry simple / hard on pixel shaders
	Occluders can be generated
	Per object occlusion culling

REsearch
	How long it takes to bake the HiZ chain.
	How to calculate the screenspace AABB in vertex shader.
	Spheres instead of AABB
	Predicate rendering no es lo mismo? O hay que esperar el resutlado del query. 
	Parece que el visibility result del predicate rendering no esta disponible en shaders.

Prevents:
	LEss gpu stalling, No results need to be get from GPU.

Good for:
	Pixel shader bound geometry. Intensive pixel shader
	Relatively low geometry.
	Can be implemented without compute shaders
	LOD?
	
Drawbacks
	Instancing?
	Calculation of occluders
